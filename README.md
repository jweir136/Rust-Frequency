# Frequency

Frequency is a Rust crate that includes all the tools you need in order to incorporate frequency related actions in your project. A frequency is used to measure how often a particular event occurs. For example, frequency is used to measure how often the peak occurs in a [sine wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave). The standard unit of measurement for frequency is hertz (Hz), but measurements can also be in GigaHertz, MegaHertz, etc.

A [Period](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(physics)) is the inverse of frequency. It refers to how long a it takes a complete cycle to occur. It can be calculated by doing 1/f where f is the frequency in hertz. Additionally, frequency can also be converted from period by doing f = 1/T where T is the period in seconds.
